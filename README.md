# C implementation of the Grass Planting Language

This is an implementation of the [Grass Planting Language](http://www.blue.sky.or.jp/grass/ "Grass Planting Language")

There are no requirements or other notable things when compiling and running.
The program has two modes, reading from a file or interactive with -i.

Feel free to report bugs or to make suggestions on how to improve the code, I am not very experienced with C.
